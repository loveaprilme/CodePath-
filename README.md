Hi Ms. Wilson, 

Airbnb and CodePath have partnered together to offer an all-expenses paid Android and iOS mobile 8-week development course to 50 external engineers and Airbnb Connect participants in your university starting March 2, 2020. Over the past few years, CodePath has trained 2000+ engineers at 100+ companies in Silicon Valley. We’re proud of the fact that no individual has ever paid for a CodePath course.

We believe the best education in the world should be freely accessible and we’ve been fortunate to work with great companies like Facebook, Airbnb, and top Silicon Valley companies to help make this vision a reality. Alumni of CodePath classes include one of the co-founders of Reddit, a former tech lead for Apple Watch, head of Android for Coursera and many now prominent iOS and Android developers across Silicon Valley.

The class is based on interactive lectures and labs. You are actually coding in class, not copy-pasting from a book, like you may have at previous corporate training seminars. You will also complete app assignments and group projects that will enable you to build fully functional apps for either Android or iOS platforms.

Students will get to interact with Airbnb engineers throughout the course and Airbnb will offer top performers the opportunity to interview for a full-time role within Airbnb.

If you’re a software engineer with 1+ years of work experience who wants to learn mobile, apply now: [CodePath-Airbnb](http://www.codepath.com/courses/airbnb) or to learn more please visit our website [CodePath Classes](https://codepath.org/classes)

The class takes place Tuesday/Thursday from 7-9PM for 2 hours. You can apply for either Android or iOS. We also offer a remote Android and iOS option for all US-based applicants and highly encourage you to apply.

The deadline is February 21. Apply now! Make sure that you take time to finish your pre-work so start as soon as you can.

Hoping to hear from you soon!


Best regards, 
April Aquitania – Program Coordinator
